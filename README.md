# Java-Graphs-Assignment
Spring 2022 Data Structures &amp; Algorithms Assignment 6

Topic: Graphs

Download the code provided by the textbook in order to complete this program.
We all know by now that any acyclic connected graph can be considered a tree. Write a program
that for the purpose of practicing with these structures "maps" a BST to a Graph.
In previous assignments you have read a word (a String) from the keyboard, dissected it into
its single letters and configured these letters into a Binary Search Tree. (The word will be all in
Caps.)You are going to start with the same process here. But then you will take your BST and
store it in a Graph.

This means that you should visit every node in the BST and not only store that as a vertex in the
array that represents the Graph, but also populate the adjacency matrix based on the parent-child
relationship that you detect in your BST.
An important point to remember is that the order of the vertices in the vertex array does not tell
us anything about the connectivity of these vertices. Itâ€™s all about the adjacency matrix that
determines the connectivity pattern of the graph.

Add the following methods to the code given in the textbook:
displayVertexList()
displayAdjMatrix()

Make sure this method displays the matrix in a tabular format with rows and columns in an
organized manner for readability.
We are going to let the user decide whether they want this to be a directed or undirected graph.
So the next question to the user would be the following:
Map the BST into:
1. Directed Graph
2. Undirected Graph

Please note that in case of the user choice for directed graph, we use the parent-child direction:
from parent to the child.
After mapping the BST into the proper Graph, you will display the following menu and let the
user choose from the options:
1. Display the BST in a tree format.
2. Display the Vertex array.
3. Display the Adjacency Matrix
4. Given a vertex: Display ALL possible separate paths starting with that
 vertex in a Depth First Search pattern:
 Enter the letter:
5. Given a vertex: Display ALL its adjacent vertices (one edge apart)
 Enter the letter:
6. Given a vertex: Display ALL the vertices that are two edges away from
 it:
 Enter the letter:
7. Exit

A Note: You start this program by reading the user input string into a BST, you should hold on to
your BST object, in case at any point the user chooses option 1 which is to display this tree as a
visual tree.
But any other operations other than one on option 1, MUST BE DONE ON GRAPH VERSION
OF THIS TREE. For example in order to find the adjacent vertices of a given vertex YOU
CANNOT TRAVERSE THE BST, YOU SHOULD USE THE ADJACENCY MATRIX.
PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT ANY TREE OPERATION IS GOING TO BE CONSIDERED
VOID FOR THIS PROBLEM. THIS IS NOT A TREE PROGRAM!
Here are additional explanations of some of the menu options:
**Option 4.** Here is an example of this option referring to figure 13.5 on page 625 in the
textbook (acknowledging that our graph will be based on a BST and will look differently than
this figure): If the user enters letter A, The following would be ALL the paths in a depth first
search pattern that starts with A:
ABFH
AC
ADGI
AE
**Option 5.** Referring to the Figure 13.5 example again: if the input is letter G, the one edge
apart vertices would be D and I.
Please note that for options 4 and 5, you should modify the code in the book so that you can
specify the index of the vertex you would like to choose as starting point. Currently the code
starts at index 0 (hard coded for this value.) you need to change that. Again you can safely
assume the user input will be valid.
**Option 6.** Again referring to the above example: given vertex A, the vertices two edges away
would be: F and G. Obviously in case no vertices fit the criteria, you should display a message
accordingly.
